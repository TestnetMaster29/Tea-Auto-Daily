## üîß Installation Guide  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TestnetMaster29/Tea-Auto-Daily.git
cd Tea-Auto-Daily
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Install dependencies**

npm install
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure Wallet**

Then edit the `wallets.json` file and fill in your wallet and token data:

**Example for a single wallet:**
```json
[
  {
    "PRIVATE_KEY": "your_private_key",
    "TOKEN_ADDRESS": "your_token_contract_address"
  }
]
```

**Example for multiple wallets:**
```json
[
  {
    "PRIVATE_KEY": "private_key_1",
    "TOKEN_ADDRESS": "token_contract_address_1"
  },
  {
    "PRIVATE_KEY": "private_key_2",
    "TOKEN_ADDRESS": "token_contract_address_2"
  }
  // and so on...
]
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure Telegram Bot (Optional)**

To get automatic notifications via Telegram:

- Create a new bot using [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy its token.
- Get the `chat_id` of the user or group, using a bot like [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).
- Create a new file named `.env` and fill it with:
```bash
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
CHAT_ID=your_chat_id
```
- Save this file in the root project folder.

If the `.env` file is not found, the script will still run but without notifications.
